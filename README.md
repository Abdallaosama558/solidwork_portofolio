# ⚙️ 3D CAD Modeling Portfolio: Advanced SolidWorks Designs
This repository presents a comprehensive collection of 3D CAD models developed entirely in SolidWorks. The project serves as a demonstration of advanced parametric modeling techniques, proper mechanical assembly construction, and adherence to industry-standard engineering documentation practices across a diverse range of product categories.

# 🚀 Project Objective
The primary goal of this portfolio is to showcase proficiency in SolidWorks by creating detailed, fully-constrained, and functional models. Each component and assembly is built with a strong parametric design intent, allowing for scalable modification and analysis.

# 🛠️ Components Included in This Project
The models are categorized below, demonstrating complexity from multi-part mechanical systems to complex surface-modeled consumer products.

# 1. Mechanical Assemblies
Detailed systems highlighting complex mating, motion, and multi-part interaction.

Bicycle Fork Assembly: Includes the steerer tube, crown, legs, and dropouts. Features fully defined mates and motion alignment.

Drawer Assembly: A multi-part sliding mechanism, complete with rail guides and alignment mates.

Archery Gun Assembly: Focuses on mechanical components like the trigger system, bow arms, and main frame, illustrating potential motion.

Mouse Assembly: An intricate assembly of internal electronics (PCB), a scroll wheel mechanism, click mechanisms, and a multi-part ergonomic housing.

# 2. Consumer Products
Models emphasizing complex surfacing, ergonomic design, and visual realism.

Coke Bottle: Demonstrates advanced surface modeling, lofts, guide curves, and a fully threaded bottle neck.

Headphones: Features adjustable headband, detailed ear cups/cushions, and swivel hinge joints (utilizing sub-assemblies).

Game Controller: An ergonomic shell assembly with all necessary buttons, triggers, and the D-pad. Exploded view documentation is supported.

Key Fob Cover: A two-piece enclosure utilizing accurate snap-fit locking features.

Pencil: Modeled from the wood body and graphite core to the metal ferrule and eraser.

Pencil Sharpener: A complete multi-part assembly including the blade mount and internal shaving chamber.

# 3. Electronics & Enclosures
Focuses on accurate component representation and functional enclosure design.

Circuit Board (PCB): Modeled with realistic footprints and components, including connectors, ICs, resistors, and pins.

Raspberry Pi Enclosure: A complete case shell featuring ventilation openings, screw bosses, and port cutouts modeled to specification.

# 4. Aerodynamic Components
Components built for specific engineering analysis purposes.

Propellers: Features twisted airfoil geometry suitable for rotation studies or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis.

# ✨ Modeling Standards and Practices
The following standards were rigorously applied to ensure model quality, maintainability, and professional documentation:

Parametric Design Intent: Models are built for scalable modification, with dimensions linked to global variables where beneficial.

Sketching: All sketches are fully defined and constrained (black lines only) to prevent unintended geometry changes.

Organization: Clear naming conventions are used consistently for features, sketches, parts, and configurations.

Materials: Realistic materials are assigned to all parts (e.g., ABS, Aluminum, PET, Steel) to support rendering and simulation.

Assembly Techniques: Assemblies rely on standard and mechanical mates, including:

Concentric, Coincident, Parallel, and Lock mates.

Effective use of sub-assemblies for large systems (e.g., headphones, mouse, drawer rails).
